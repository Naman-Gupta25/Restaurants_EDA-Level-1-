# 📊 Descriptive Exploratory Data Analysis & Univariate Insights on Restaurant Data

This project is a deep dive into Descriptive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Univariate Analysis, focused on extracting meaningful insights from a real-world restaurant dataset. Rather than limiting the scope to basic visualizations, I adopted a strong analytical mindset, applying critical thinking, perspective, and data-driven questioning to uncover hidden patterns within the data.

The objective was not only to analyze what is happening in the dataset but to understand why it is happening.

Rather than treating EDA as a checklist, I approached this dataset with curiosity and intention :

What is the data trying to tell? What patterns are hidden? Which variable truly drives customer behavior?

This way of thinking shaped every decision in the notebook — from feature selection to assumptions, transformations, and visualization.

This notebook showcases a developing data scientist’s mindset — the ability to:

✔ Think critically

✔ Frame the right problem

✔ Ask the right questions

✔ Translate data into insight

It reflects my skill not just in Python or Pandas, but in how I approach data.

## 🔍 What makes this project different?

While most EDA projects focus on simple trends, I took an extra step ahead by carefully framing the right questions before jumping into analysis. This allowed me to explore the data from multiple dimensions:

### On City basis:

Overall top cities by restaurant count

Distribution of cuisines across cities

Identification of most popular cuisine in each city

Variance in average cost for two and price range across cities

Franchise and chain concentration in metro locations

### On Cuisine basis:

Most famous cuisines in countries and cities

Global popularity of specific cuisines

Top-rated restaurants by cuisine, rating, votes, and locality

### On Country basis:

Country-wise restaurant distribution

Top franchises per country

Regional concentration of restaurants

Price range and cost variation among countries

## Additional analytical thinking applied:

Customer trust analysis: Franchise vs Individual restaurant impact

Locality-based clustering of restaurants

Effect of location type (mall, park, public places)

Relationship between rating, votes, location, and cost

## Geospatial Analysis
